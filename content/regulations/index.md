## Post-Construction Site Runoff Controls (PCSO) 

### City of Raleigh, North Carolina 

Illicit Discharge Detection and Elimination (IDDE) - BMPs to detect and eliminate illicit discharges to the City’s MS4; address significant sources of pollutants to the MS4; implement appropriate enforcement procedures and actions; maintain a map showing the City’s major MS4 outfalls to state waters receiving direct discharges; and inform employees, businesses, and the general public of hazards associated with illegal discharges and improper disposal of waste.

Construction Site Runoff Controls - BMPs to reduce pollutants in stormwater runoff from construction activities disturbing one acre or more of land surface and to provide procedures for public input, sanctions to ensure compliance, requirements for construction site operators to implement appropriate erosion and sediment control practices, review of site plans, and procedures for site inspection and enforcement of control measures. The City’s unified development ordinance (UDO) exceeds this MS4 permit requirement, requiring SCMs to reduce pollutants in stormwater runoff from construction activities disturbing 12,000 square feet or more of land surface. The City’s UDO also includes procedures for public input, sanctions to ensure compliance,
requirements for construction site operators to implement appropriate erosion and sediment control practices, review of site plans, and procedures for site inspection and enforcement of control measures. This City program is authorized within the corporate limits and the Extra Territorial Jurisdiction (ETJ) area.

Post-Construction Site Runoff Controls - BMPs to manage stormwater runoff from development that drains to the City’s MS4 and to waters within the ETJ area, to provide a mechanism requiring long-term operation and maintenance of SCMs, and to ensure controls are in place to minimize water quality impacts. This City program is authorized within the corporate limits and the ETJ area.
